		<h3>About Moi</h3>
			<p> Hi there! My name is Bella Oriella, and yes, my name really does rhyme. I've been a graphic designer for the past seven years and have a wide variety of experience with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. I dabble in everything from print to digital, layout to logos, and apparel to branding. I freelance regularly and am currently looking for a job as a creative at an ad agency, a designer at a well-known company or a layout designer at a magazine. <br>
		 	<br>
			I recently graduated from Tufts University with a major in Art History and a minor in Communications. While I'm originally from Cleveland, I'm looking forward to staying in the Boston area for the next year or so and learning more about the art of design. <br>
			<br> 
			Fun Facts: I speak French and Italian, I was in the world's largest children's circus, I love traveling, I was an extra on the set of a major blockbuster, and I was in a body empowering dance troupe at Tufts. </p>
